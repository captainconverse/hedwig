A Confirmed Breach will always be an Academic Integrity incident type, while a Prevented Breach will have a more specific incident type.  This is because all Confirmed Breaches impact Academic Integrity, while a Prevented Breach was a specific action needing to be corrected that may not necessarily be an intentional breach of academic integrity.  An example would be speaking aloud during the exam, but the behavior was stopped when directed by the proctor.</dd>
